## GOALS ##
1. Create a webpage w/ 16X16 grid
    -Create divs using JS
    -Put grid squares inside another "container" div (in html)
    -Ways to to make divs appear as a grid
        -float/clear
        -inline-block
        -flexbox
        -CSS Grid
2. Set up a "hover" effect so the grid divs change color when your mouse passes over them (leaving a trail)
    -"Hovering" is what happens when your mouse enters a div and ends when it leaves it. Can set up event listeners for either of those events.
    -Ways to change the color of the divs
        -adding a new class to the div
        -changing the div's background color using JS
3. Add a button to the top of the screen which will clear current grid and send the user a popup asking for the number of squares per side fot the new grid.
    -New grid should be generated in the SAME total space as before
    -Set limit for user input to a maximum of 100
    -Research button tags in HTML and how you can make a JS function run when one is clicked
    -check out prompts
4. ##OPTIONAL## Have each pass through with the mouse change it to a completely random RGB value. Ty having each pass just add another 10% of black to it so that only after 10 passes the square is completely black.
